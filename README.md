# Simulated-Annealing

The goal of Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP) is to find the order in which to visit a set of cities so that the total distance traveled is minimized.
One of the oldest and simplest techniques for solving combinatorial optimization problems is called Simulated Annealing(SA).

Here, the Metaheuristic algorithm, Simulated Annealing is used to solve the TSP and visualize it using Pygame.
